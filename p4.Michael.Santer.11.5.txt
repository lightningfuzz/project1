I accidentally submitted my project3 document to this project4 turn it by accident. Didn’t notice until I went to turn this document in. I emailed you about it.

Points of Interest:

-I implemented the ability to delete appointments. When you hover your mouse over an appointment, a red ‘x’ will appear. 

-Appointments sort into correct chronological order upon entry

- Times appear in “am/pm” form, however, the database saves the data in “military” form (0-23). This just sounded more proper to me because it allows for reusability of the database schema.
